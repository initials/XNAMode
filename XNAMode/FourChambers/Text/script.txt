Cheat Codes:

On the importance of cheat codes.

When I was about 8 years old, I showed my Dad the DOKIPEN cheat in Action Fighter. He told me the programmers put them in so they can test things quickly without rebuilding the code. I disagreed. I discarded his years of hammering databases, and focused on what the cheat codes could do for me. I maintained that cheats were put in the game so that cool kids who took the time to read Electronic Gaming Monthly could impress their friend.

Years later I was a teenager and like most teenagers I thought I knew it all. I had it all figured out in my world weary head. I had been on the internet, I'd been into the forums, even the unpopular ones. I had pieced together how video games were made from interviews and industry news. 

Now I thought cheat codes were a time delayed publicity stunt. Sure once the kids heard about Donkey Kong mode in Goldeneye it would "shift" a few more "units". Cheat codes were now set in my mind as nothing more than a news item. Nothing to do with the game, in many cases ruining the game.

Now that I'm programming my own games, and I'm 45824 lines of code deep, I'm realising that like most times in my life, my Dad was right. Cheat codes mainly exist for the programmer, not the consumer.
