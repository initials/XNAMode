Thanks for downloading the Xbox 360 Button Pack 3 from Sinnix.net. I hope you find it useful and I wish you the best of luck with your game. (or whatever else you're doing with them)

All of these buttons have be designed with television in mind and I have personally tested them on a variety of television screens to ensure maximum legibility. I have also colour corrected them to reduce colour bleed and other TV artifacts.  All that being said, I know a lot of people like to use my stuff on websites and they look awesome on a PC screen too.
